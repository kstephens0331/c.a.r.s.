# 🚀 C.A.R.S Collision Shop - Ready for Deployment

## All Fixes Complete - Ready for Tony's Call

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed Today

### 1. **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### **Inventory Deduction Bug** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/CustomerDetailsPage.jsx:241`
- **Issue**: Inventory wasn't decreasing when parts were added to work orders
- **Fix**: Changed `.eq('user_id', selectedPartId)` → `.eq('id', selectedPartId)`
- **Impact**: Parts inventory now properly tracks usage

#### **Customer Data Privacy Bug** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/portal/RepairUpdates.jsx:36-54`
- **Issue**: Customers could see ALL vehicles and repairs (not just theirs)
- **Fix**: Added proper customer filtering based on logged-in user
- **Impact**: Major security fix - customers now only see their own data

#### **Non-existent Column Bug** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/Inventory.jsx`
- **Issue**: UI tried to display `supplier` column that doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Replaced with `Date Added` column using `created_at`
- **Impact**: Inventory page displays correctly

#### **Login/Register Text Not Visible** ✅
- **Files**:
  - `src/pages/portal/CustomerLogin.jsx:80,89`
  - `src/pages/portal/RegisterPage.jsx:56,65`
- **Issue**: White text on white background (invisible input text)
- **Fix**: Added `text-gray-900` class to all input fields
- **Impact**: Users can now see what they're typing

   - Workaround: Add via Supabase dashboard
   - Future: Build inventory management UI

2. Email uses test domain
   - Workaround: Works fine for testing
   - Future: Verify collisionandrefinish.com in Resend

3. No invoice generation
   - Invoices page exists but may be incomplete
   - Future: Add invoice creation/editing

### **None of these block Tony's demo or production use!**
