# ✅ Resend Email Integration - COMPLETE

## Summary

Email notifications are now fully integrated using Resend! Customers will automatically receive professional email notifications when their repair status is updated.

---

## What Was Completed

### ✅ 1. Resend API Key Configured
- API Key: `re_NhfeUTM5_FzP1HhF8h8TnXPmHMy5kQkhp`
- Stored securely in Supabase secrets
- No passwords needed!

### ✅ 2. Edge Function Updated
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/status-update-email/index.ts`
- **Old version backed up**: `index.ts.backup`
- **New features**:
  - Uses Resend API (no Gmail/SMTP needed)
  - Beautiful HTML email template
  - Includes vehicle details (Year, Make, Model)
  - Work order number
  - Professional branding
  - Responsive design

### ✅ 3. WorkOrders.jsx Integration
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/WorkOrders.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added automatic email sending when status changes
  - Error handling (won't break if email fails)
  - Success message shows "Customer notified via email"
  - Logs email status to console

---

## How It Works

1. **Admin updates work order status** in `/admin/work-orders`
2. **Status saves to database** (work_orders table)
3. **Email automatically sends** via Resend API
4. **Customer receives** professional email with:
   - Their vehicle info
   - New status
   - Link to customer portal
   - Professional C.A.R.S branding

---

---

## Testing the Integration

### Method 1: Test with Real Work Order (Recommended)

1. **Go to Admin Panel**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/work-orders`
   - Log in as admin

2. **Update a Status**:
   - Find any work order
   - Change the status dropdown
   - Watch for success message: "Status updated successfully. Customer notified via email."

3. **Check Customer Email**:
   - The customer should receive an email within seconds
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

4. **Verify in Console**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab
   - Should see: "Email notification sent successfully"

### Method 2: Test in Resend Dashboard

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails
2. **View sent emails**: You'll see all emails sent
3. **Check delivery status**: Click on any email to see details

---

## Important Notes

### Email "From" Address

**Currently using**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain)

**For production**, you should:
1. Verify your own domain in Resend (collisionandrefinish.com)
2. Update line 56 in `supabase/functions/status-update-email/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'C.A.R.S Collision <noreply@collisionandrefinish.com>'
   ```

### Free Tier Limits

Resend Free Tier:
- ✅ 3,000 emails per month
- ✅ 100 emails per day
- ✅ More than enough for a collision shop

If you exceed limits:
- Upgrade to $20/month for 50,000 emails
- Or contact Resend support

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for error messages

2. **Check Supabase Edge Function Logs**:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vbxrcqtjpcyhylanozgz/functions
   - Click on "status-update-email"
   - View logs for errors

3. **Check Resend Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://resend.com/emails
   - See if emails are being sent but bouncing

4. **Verify API Key**:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets list
   ```
   Should show `RESEND_API_KEY`

### Customer Email Missing?

The edge function checks for customer email. If missing:
- Email won't send
- Check `customers` table has email for that customer
- Status update still works (email is non-blocking)
