============================================
EVERYTHING STILL WORKS PERFECTLY
============================================

IMPORTANT: I made ZERO changes to your existing functionality. Everything you've been using still works exactly the same - I only ADDED new features. Your data is completely safe.

============================================
💳 PAYMENT PROCESSING - DECISION NEEDED
============================================

I want to discuss adding ONLINE PAYMENT PROCESSING to your customer portal.

This would allow customers to:
- Pay invoices directly from their portal
- Pay with credit/debit cards
- Automatic payment tracking tied to work orders
- Secure, professional checkout experience

PAYMENT PROCESSOR OPTIONS:

1. STRIPE (My Recommendation)
   - 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
   - Most popular, very reliable
   - Next-day payouts
   - Great fraud protection

2. SQUARE
   - 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
   - Integrates with Square hardware (if you use it)
   - Good for unified payment system

3. PAYPAL
   - 3.49% + $0.49 per transaction (higher fees)
   - Very trusted name
   - Instant setup

WHY YOU NEED THIS:
- Faster payments (customers can pay immediately)
- Convenience (pay from phone, no need to come back)
- Professional (modern businesses offer online payments)
- Automatic tracking (payments mark invoices as paid)
- Better cash flow (get paid faster)

HOW IT WOULD WORK:
1. Work order is completed
2. Invoice is generated (with your logo)
3. Customer receives email/SMS notification
4. Customer logs into portal
5. Sees work order with "Pay Now" button
6. Enters card info securely
7. Payment processed
8. Invoice automatically marked as PAID
9. You get money in 1-2 business days

WE NEED TO DISCUSS:
- Which payment processor you prefer
- Whether you want to charge customers the fee or absorb it
- Your business bank account info (for setup)

I can have this integrated within a week once we choose!

============================================
ACTION ITEMS NEEDED FROM YOU
============================================

1. PAYMENT PROCESSING DECISION (PLEASE RESPOND!)
   - Which payment processor? (Stripe, Square, or PayPal)
   - Pass fee to customers or absorb it?

2. CUSTOMER LIST (HIGH PRIORITY)
   Send me your current customer list in ANY format:
   - Excel/CSV file
   - Word document
   - Even a list in an email works!

   What I need for each customer:
   - Customer Name
   - Phone Number
   - Email Address (if available)
   - Address (if available)

   Example:
   John Smith, (832) 555-1234, john@email.com, 123 Main St, Spring TX 77388
   Jane Doe, (832) 555-5678, jane@email.com, 456 Oak Ave, Spring TX 77388

3. ACTIVE WORK ORDERS (OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL)
   If you have any current work orders in progress:
   - Customer name
   - Vehicle info (Year, Make, Model, VIN, License Plate)
   - What work is being done
   - Current status
   - Estimated completion date

4. PARTS INVENTORY (OPTIONAL)
   If you want your current inventory loaded:
   - Part numbers
   - Descriptions
   - Quantities on hand
   - Unit prices
   - Suppliers

FORMAT DOESN'T MATTER - I can work with whatever you have!
